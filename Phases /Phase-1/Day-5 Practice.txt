🔵 Lab 5 — RAG Lite (Manual)
•	Upload docs
•	Chunking
•	Overlap
•	Retrieval
•	Prompt grounding
(No Azure AI Search yet — simple version.)


Goal:
Take retrieved chunks → inject into prompt → force grounding → return answer + citation.
NO Azure AI Search yet.
NO orchestration frameworks.
Pure Python + Azure OpenAI.

🧪 What Lab-5 Adds on top of your code
You already finished Steps 1–8.
Now we add:
________________________________________
🔵 Step-9 — Build Retrieved Context Block
After your similarity loop:
retrieved_docs = [documents[i] for i in best]

context = "\n".join(
    f"[Doc {idx+1}] {doc}"
    for idx, doc in enumerate(retrieved_docs)
)

print("Retrieved context:\n", context)
This simulates what Azure AI Search would later return.
________________________________________
________________________________________
🔵 Step-10 — Grounded Prompt Template
We now force the model:
• use ONLY retrieved text
• refuse if not present
• cite sources
Add:
system_prompt = """
You are a churn prediction assistant.

Answer ONLY from the provided context.
If the answer is not in the context, say: "Information not available in the provided documents."

Always cite sources like [Doc 1].
"""

user_prompt = f"""
Context:
{context}

Question:
{query}
"""

________________________________________
🔵 Step-11 — Call Chat Model with Grounding
⚠️ You must already have a chat deployment (GPT-4o / GPT-35 / etc).
Add:
chat_deployment = "your-chat-deployment-name"

chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=chat_deployment,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt},
    ],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=200,
)

print(chat_response.choices[0].message.content)
print("Usage:", chat_response.usage)
________________________________________
________________________________________
🔵 Step-12 — Citation Enforcement Test
Change query to something NOT in docs:
query = "Do customers in Europe churn more?"
Expected:
Information not available in the provided documents.
If it hallucinates → grounding failed ❌.
________________________________________
________________________________________
🔵 Step-13 — Chunking Simulation
Replace documents with longer paragraphs:
documents = [
    "Customers on month-to-month contracts churn more often because they are not locked in...",
    "Fiber optic users typically pay higher monthly charges compared to DSL...",
    "Long tenure customers are less likely to churn because loyalty increases..."
]
Later we’ll automate chunking — for now you’re seeing why:
👉 small chunks = precise retrieval
👉 big chunks = noise + cost
________________________________________
________________________________________
🔵 Step-14 — Overlap Concept (Manual)
Simulate overlapping chunks:
documents = [
    "Customers on month-to-month contracts churn more often. They are free to cancel anytime.",
    "They are free to cancel anytime and often leave when prices rise.",
]
Notice retrieval improves because overlapping info appears twice.
________________________________________
________________________________________
🔵 Step-15 — Log Tokens for Cost Awareness
You already printed:
Usage(prompt_tokens=XX, completion_tokens=YY)
Write in notebook:
• context size ↑ → tokens ↑
• Top-K ↑ → cost ↑
• chunk size ↑ → cost ↑

✅ What You Have Now Implemented
You just built:
✔ Retrieval
✔ Vector similarity
✔ Grounding
✔ Citation forcing
✔ Hallucination prevention
✔ Cost trade-offs
✔ Chunking intuition
✔ Overlap effect
This is core RAG.

🧠 Why this matters for later
When we move to:
👉 Azure AI Search
👉 hybrid search
👉 HNSW
👉 filters
👉 reranker
ALL of that replaces:
store["vectors"]
cosine_similarity()
—but the logic stays identical.

🛑 Stop Point for Today
When you run this:
• query
• retrieval
• grounded answer
• citations
• refusal case
Lab-5 is DONE ✅.

Start Lab-6 — Security Setup
and we continue exactly by the plan.
